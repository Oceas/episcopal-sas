Mike,"That thr Anglicab Church of Canada, a long with the Episcopal Church comes to repentance for going against the Word of God in regards to the LGBTQ issue! God is clear in His Word when it comes to marriage, sex, sexuality, and who may and may not serve as deacon, elder, pastor/bishop!

Women are more than qualified to be pastors, just like men, provided they are Biblically orthodox! The reason why Paul forbade some women from ministry was because of their heresy (1 Timothy and the women of Ephesus, 1 Corinthians 14 and the women of Corinth)! Paul, we know from Acts 18 and Romans 16, had no issue with women in ministry, in fact the one who gave him training was pastor Priscilla (Prisca) in Acts 18! 
Schori was a disgrace of a bishop, as is Curry now! Gene Robinson should have never been a bishop (he committed adultery according to Matthew 19, et al., and because of his choice In ‚Äúmarrying‚Äù and then divorcing a man)! Your church is the reason why the Anglican Church in North America exists, I applaud ANiC/ACNA for their devotion to God‚Äôs Word and their ecangelical zeal for taking the stand they did! I also applaud my dear friends, Rev. Smith and her husband George here in the city I live in here in Canada. Maggie and George, originally from the UK (she actually went to the same school as Justin Welby, and is friends with him to this very day), felt God calling her to Canada. Her husband was able to find a job here in the city, and Maggie started at a church here. When her and her husband first came to this part of the commonwealth, they already experienced the baptism in the Spirit. As she saw things go more and more downhill, she knew God was calling her to something else. She started a church plant on her own. A nondenominational Anglican Mission where the Spirit is free to move, the charismatic gifts are evident at each service, and high church (BCP) is the service liturgy of choice (including bells and smells). They‚Äôve also gone back to a Biblical form of baptism initiation rites, full immersion believers baptism [no infant baptism, and no confirmation as that is repugnant to Scripture (cf. Articles of Religion Article 34)].

Heather Hitt,"I am living in an apartment complex where I am the minority. I‚Äôm a single white mom with a half Hispanic toddler. I have been here for two years. The new district manager happens to be extremely racist. She has chosen not to renew my lease because I responded to some racist commentary that she and other black staff members were making whenever I went to the office to address a maintenance issue when she first took over this property a year or so ago.

She has now, by her negative actions towards me (and towards others) put me in a position where I will have no home in a month and I will be in a homeless shelter and likely lose my daughter due to her discriminatory actions against me and my child (and our doggo). I will be facing not being able to finish the classes that I am enrolled in at Tarleton State University. If I flunk these classes then I am not going to be able to graduate due to finances and having had a tough go of it when I first tried college fifteen years ago. 

My life has only recently been restored and now, with one act of hate and discrimination, it is being obliterated .

I need prayer; prayer that God is my vengeance and allows me and my small family to stay together. I am so grateful for what I have been given and what I have been able to build and accomplish and begin to accomplish since my child‚Äôs father was taken away. I need prayer that a hedge of protection is built around us and that we are allowed to retain what we have worked for and built and that we, within the will of God, will become greater and stronger than our adversaries in the coming months.

We need prayers that our guardian angels and the saints that we revere will hold us fast and close and keep us. 

Prayers for strength and for forgiveness of any trespasses that have been made against others and the humility to forgive those who have trespassed against me and my family.

Prayers for forgiveness of debts and oversight of transgressions.

Prayers for those who have been blessings in my life and prayers for those who will be blessings in the future .

Prayers that I will be able to bless others and not be a burden.

Prayers that this act of hate against me and my family will be turned around and used as a blessing.

Prayers for the safety and well-being of my child and her dog. Prayers for the sanctity of our family. 

Prayers for spiritual intervention in this time of uncertainty that has been made more uncertain by the hatred and greed of another... and by my relentless grievances against her and the property that she so poorly runs. 

Prayers for forgiveness . Prayers for the Holy Spirit to intervene. 

Prayers for health (as mine is fading sooner than it should). Prayers for the peace of the Lord to hold me and my sanity together during this outrageously stressful time.

No more whammies, God. You have almost thrown more at me than I can handle. Grace is needed now. I cannot stand any more severe trials and tribulations . I have repented and turned from ways. Your will has been done over and over again and it is breaking me, not building me.

Prayers for my deceased brother‚Äôs family that was left behind. And prayers that he finds his way home.",0,2021-03-18 01:35:54
Heather Hitt,"Prayer for the children in the neighborhood where I live is needed. These children are neglected and abused. They are left outside on the streets by their parents... to be raised by the streets. When they scream they are screaming for guidance and I pray that they are sent a guiding hand. I pray for them to be shown a better, righteous way that is paved by righteousness. I pray for their safety in an unsafe world. And I pray for their parents. I pray that their parents will see the true face of God and love and true joy. I pray that they will see truth amd led away from the popular opinion that is so tainted with sin and error that people cannot even see straight anymore. They cannot tell right from wrong because they are being fed lies that say wrong is righteous and sin is a manmade equation. I understand why they so readily fall into this trap. And I pray they are freed from the lies that are being bled into them. I pray that they find truth and justice. And I pray they find true love within themselves, love that can only come from you, Lord. I pray that the spirit of deceit that dwells so heavily among your people is taken away and that the veil of lies that has been placed over the eyes of your people is lifted and destroyed. 

Your will be done, not mine.",0,2021-03-18 02:03:29

I pray for the Lord to forgive me for what I felt I could not do for him in order to help keep him off the streets, 

I pray that if he chooses to keep walking the streets that the Saints follow him and walk with him. I rebuke the evil that surrounds him and his thoughts, in the name of Christ Jesus.
